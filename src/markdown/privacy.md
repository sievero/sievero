# Privacy Policy

## Information we collect

**The only personal information we collect is your email address**, which is required in order to send you job applications links. We cannot tie this information to you as an individual.

If you reply to one of our emails and sign your name, obviously, we will be able to tie an email address to a name. However, signing your name is entirely voluntarily. We will just address you by your email address if you do not provide a name. 

To remove your email address from our records, simply unsubscribe from job alerts via any email that we've sent you.

When you unsubscribe, we may keep records of how you used our services (for example, the skills and job preferences you gave us), any feedback you provided, and any other information you give us that is not personally identifiable information. Your personal information will be anonymized and removed from our records. The records we keep are used to evaluate and improve the quality of our services.

We don't have a reason to keep your personal information after you have unsubscribed. We value your privacy and do not sell your data.

**We do not use cookies, ads, or trackers of any kind.**

## Information collected by third parties

This site relies on third parties whose privacy policies may apply to you. While we don't collect any information from you besides an email address, these third parties may receive your email address for the purpose of delivering our services to you. We use the following third parties for the below purposes and have provided links to their privacy policies:

- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/privacy/): emailing us when you create a job alert
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy/): location autocomplete field
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy/): error logging
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/privacy): storing the information you enter into the form

The only companies to which we directly send your email address is Zapier and Airtable. Since Algolia and Sentry are integrated with this site, we cannot guarantee they aren't somehow pulling your email from the site, which is why we encourage understanding their privacy policies, as well as ours.

When you unsubscribe from job alerts, we will remove your email address from our records. We will also attempt to remove record of your email from the above third-party companies, however, be mindful that they may keep that data stored in accordance with their data retention policy.
